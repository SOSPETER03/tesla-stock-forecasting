## üîü Conclusion & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **Best Performing Model**
After evaluating six models ‚Äî **AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM**, and implementing a **Hybrid ARIMA + LSTM**, we conclude:

> üî• **Hybrid ARIMA + LSTM** is the most accurate model for forecasting Tesla stock prices.

- It outperformed others in **RMSE, MAE, MAPE**.
- Statistically significant accuracy advantage confirmed via **Diebold-Mariano test** vs. SARIMAX (`p ‚âà 0.0000`).
