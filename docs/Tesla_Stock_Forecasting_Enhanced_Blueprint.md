# Advanced Time Series Forecasting of Tesla Stock

## Comparative Analysis Blueprint (Enhanced)

---

## 1. Data Acquisition & Preparation

- Download Tesla stock data using `yfinance`
- Clean missing values (forward fill, interpolation)
- Convert 'Date' to datetime and set as index
- Feature Engineering:
  - Daily returns
  - Log returns
  - Lag features
  - Rolling statistics (mean, std)
- Outlier detection using boxplots and IQR
- Initial data checks: shape, data types, and frequency range
- Visual and statistical stationarity checks (ADF & KPSS)
- Differencing as needed to achieve stationarity

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize closing price, returns, and volatility
- Boxplot analysis for outliers in returns and volume
- Descriptive stats: mean, std, skewness, kurtosis
- ACF/PACF plots for lags and autocorrelation
- STL decomposition or moving average smoothing
- Correlation matrix of engineered features

---

## 3. Classical Time Series Modeling

- Fit AR, MA, ARIMA models
- Use ACF/PACF to guide parameter selection
- Fit via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Evaluate using:
  - AIC / BIC
  - RMSE / MAE / MAPE
  - Residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box, ACF of residuals)

---

## 4. Seasonal Modeling (SARIMA)

- Identify seasonal period (e.g., 12 months)
- Apply SARIMA(P,D,Q)(p,d,q)[s] structure
- Perform seasonal differencing
- Evaluate seasonal model performance and diagnostics

---

## 5. Exogenous Predictor Models (ARIMAX / SARIMAX)

- Add regressors: Volume, Lagged Returns, or macro indicators
- Fit SARIMAX model to capture both seasonality and exogenous variables
- Evaluate and compare with SARIMA

---

## 6. Seasonal Decomposition

- Use STL or classical decomposition
- Extract and visualize trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Use insights to refine SARIMA or ARIMA model configs

---

## 7. Deep Learning with LSTM

- Normalize data, generate sequences
- Create LSTM architecture (LSTM → Dropout → Dense)
- Train/test split, batch training
- Visualize predicted vs. actual values
- Compare LSTM to ARIMA and SARIMA

---

## 8. Hybrid Modeling

- Combine ARIMA trend modeling with LSTM residual modeling
- Use hybrid forecasts to improve accuracy
- Compare hybrid vs standalone models

---

## 9. Model Evaluation & Comparison

- Compare ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, LSTM, Hybrid
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, AIC, BIC
- Residual plots and Ljung-Box test
- Forecast accuracy summary table
- Optional: Diebold-Mariano test for statistical significance

---

## 10. Conclusion & Recommendations

- Highlight best model(s) for Tesla stock forecasting
- Note strengths in handling seasonality or volatility
- Recommend appropriate use cases for each model
- Discuss limitations and future improvements

---

## 11. Future Work

- Integrate Facebook Prophet for trend-seasonality forecasting
- Add macroeconomic variables (interest rates, inflation)
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
- Automate retraining via GitHub Actions
