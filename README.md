# Advanced Time Series Forecasting of Tesla Stock
Comparative Analysis of Classical, Seasonal, and Deep Learning Models with Exogenous Predictors

ðŸ§  ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition, and Neural Networks for Enhanced Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive time series analysis and forecasting framework for Tesla Inc. stock prices using a diverse suite of models:
- Classical statistical models (AR, MA, ARIMA)
- Seasonal models (SARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition)
- Deep learning approaches (LSTM Neural Networks)
- Exogenous variable-enhanced models (ARIMAX, SARIMAX)
- Hybrid methodologies (combining statistical + machine learning)

## Project Details
- Data Source: Yahoo Finance via yfinance
- Stock Ticker: TSLA (Tesla Inc.)
- Time Period: January 2015 â€“ January 2024
- Programming Language: Python
- Project Type: Time Series Forecasting & Predictive Modeling

## Tools & Libraries
- pandas, numpy â€“ Data wrangling and preprocessing
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly â€“ Visualization
- statsmodels, pmdarima â€“ Classical & Seasonal time series models
- tensorflow, keras â€“ Deep learning (LSTM)
- scikit-learn â€“ Evaluation and scaling
- yfinance â€“ Stock data extraction

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Tesla's historical stock prices and returns
- Build and compare AR, MA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models
- Implement exogenous variable models (e.g., ARIMAX, SARIMAX)
- Train and evaluate deep learning models such as LSTM for sequence prediction
- Compare classical vs deep learning approaches
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - RMSE, MAE, MAPE
  - AIC / BIC
  - Ljung-Box test (residual independence)
  - Residual plots and prediction accuracy

## Model Suite
- AR, MA, ARIMA: Classical univariate models for time series
- SARIMA: Seasonal modeling with trend + seasonality
- ARIMAX / SARIMAX: Includes external regressors
- Seasonal Decomposition: Trend, Seasonality, Residual breakdown
- LSTM (RNN): Deep learning for sequential data
- Hybrid Models: Combinations (e.g., ARIMA + LSTM)

## Results Summary
âœ… Best Classical Model: SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0)[12]
âœ… Best Deep Learning Model: LSTM with TimeDistributed layers
âœ… Hybrid models performed competitively, combining low bias and high sequence learning

## Key Insights
- Seasonality and external market signals improved accuracy
- Deep learning models showed strong performance on volatile periods
- Hybrid strategies delivered the most consistent forecasts in noisy datasets
